* Is there an update monad story?
  * Can I use it to recycle the right hand sides of (<*>)'s in modified contexts
  * A computation would return the set of environment variables read and written
 
* How to do garbage collection on environments?
  * Seems to need a deep embedding
  * Is this even relevant with a logict style search

* Can we use propagators to model constraints?
  * Do we replace unification variables with just having join semilattice?
  * Better all-different constraints via the Hall Marriage problem
  * Using discrimination for things like Mehlhorn & Thiel to get more linear
    all-diffable things

* SAT solving
  * Conflict clauses should be able to promoted to be used across worlds
    so long as the latest clause that contributed a unit propagation or
    contradiction is consistent across both worlds.

* Reflection without remorse
  * Can it remove some of the performance difference between triangular
    and idempotent substitutions?
  * Can it fix up some of the hidden costs of LogicT?

* How to nicely use typed environments?
  * Vault? wants a nice unique variable supply?
      concurrent-supply

* Pointwise products of abstract domains? 

* QIP? What is the Abstract-CDCL analogue for SDCL?
  Wouldn't QIP and QMIP be necessary to handle things like deriving "cheap" 
  equivalent definitions via funext.

* Can you use WQOs rather than integer costs or mappings of domains to reals for
  cost analysis?

* What can be learned from open QBF solving?

* How do I get crlibm installed and usable dynamically for if I want to have
  nice floating point intervals?

* The polyhedral abstract domain is optimized by maintaining a dynamic partitioning
  of relational variables. The octagon domain could follow suit.

* What is an efficient encoding of polyhedral/octagon/etc. abstract domain operations that nevertheless remains functional? Can I abuse transients to allow a mostly in-place update policy between world forks?

* gappa w/ octagons?
